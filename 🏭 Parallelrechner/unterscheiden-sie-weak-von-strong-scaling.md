<div>
  In the context of high performance computing there are two common
  notions of scalability:
</div>
<ul>
  <li>The first is <i>strong scaling</i>, which is defined as how
  the solution time varies with the number of processors for a
  fixed <i>total</i> problem size.
  <li>The second is <i>weak scaling</i>, which is defined as how
  the solution time varies with the number of processors for a
  fixed problem size <i>per processor</i>.
  <li>Beides ist irref√ºhrend (Hennessy).
</ul>
