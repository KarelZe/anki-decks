## Front
Why is <b>self-supervised learning</b> favourable?

## Back
<ul>
  <li>No need for labelled data which is costly / errorprone
  <li>Use to better initialize in CNNs
  <li>Can be used for finding structures, which to force networks
  to learn semantics
  <li>Applicable in siutations where data is scarce and expensive
  to annotate e. g., medicine
</ul>
