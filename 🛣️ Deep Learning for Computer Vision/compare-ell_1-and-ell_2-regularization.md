## Front
Compare \(\ell_1\) and \(\ell_2\) <b>regularization</b>.

## Back
\(\ell_1\) regularization drives some of the weights to zero. It
leads to sparse representations and can serve as a feature selector
\(\ell_2\) regularization prefers a weight mix and shrinks the
weights. <b>Visualization:</b> <img src="paste-9df41f509d01c5b29c99e180f94f92ffd6b54486.jpg">
