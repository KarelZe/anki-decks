## Front
What is the <b>motivation</b> for <b>Inflated 3-D CNN (I3D)</b> in
<b>action recognition</b>?

## Back
3D kernel show poor peformance compared to image-based CNN on
networks trained from scratch. Improve quality by transfering
knowledge from image recognition task by using the two-stream
inflated 3-D ConvNet. (I3D) <b>Visualization:</b> <img src="paste-efc2380563afb46e337db42129638511ad57a3a2.jpg">
