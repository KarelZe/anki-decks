## Front
What are the <b>impact</b> of a wrongly chosen <b>learning
rate</b>?

## Back
The learning rate \(\eta\) is a crucial hyperparameter. If \(\eta\)
is too large, the loss will fluctuate around the minimum or, in
worst case, diverge. If \(\eta\) is too small, it will converge
slowly. <img src="paste-f8efb69019261c8708e4da840b9f4a226e3f6d3c.jpg">
