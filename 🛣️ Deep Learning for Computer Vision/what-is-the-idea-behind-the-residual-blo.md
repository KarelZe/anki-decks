### Front
What is the idea behind the residual blocks of ResNet

### Back
Use network layers to fit a residual mapping instead of the direct underlying mapping.

Instead of learning the entire mapping \(H(x)\) the residual between output and output is learned. That is, use layers to fit residual \(F(x) = H(x) - x\) instead of \(H(x)\) directly.
