## Front
Why is it necessary to deal with <b>uncertainty</b> in <b>deep
learning models</b>?

## Back
If one can measure uncertainty, we can develop models with
uncertainty in mind to prevent a deep learning component in a
system from making catastrophic choices. <b>Example:</b> breaking
autopilot in tesla, when it is not supposed to break.
