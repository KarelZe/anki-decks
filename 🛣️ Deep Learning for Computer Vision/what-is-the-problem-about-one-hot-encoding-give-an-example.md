## Front
What is the <b>problem </b>about <b>One-hot-encoding</b>? Give an example.

## Back
Classes are usually represented in binary labels
Horse: \([1,0,0]\)
Car: \([0,1,0]\)
Zebra: \([0,0,1]\)

\(\mid v(\) zebra \()-v(\) car \()|=| v(\) zebra \()-v(\) horse \() \mid\)
But zebra should be closer to horse than car!
