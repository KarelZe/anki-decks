### Front
What is Deep Visual-Semantic alignments?

### Back
A model that generates natural language descriptions of images and
their regions. The approach leverages datasets of images and their
sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal
correspondences between language and visual data. The alignment
model is based on a novel combination of <b>Convolutional Neural
Networks</b> (RCNN) over image regions, <b>bidirectional Recurrent
Neural Networks</b> over sentences, and a structured objective that
aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. Uses a
selective search for region proposals. <b>Visualization:</b>
