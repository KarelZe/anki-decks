### Front
What is Deep Visual-Semantic alignments?

### Back
A model that generates natural language descriptions of images and their regions. 

The approach leverages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal correspondences between language and visual data. 

The alignment model is based on a novel combination of <b>Convolutional Neural Networks</b> (RCNN) over image regions, <b>bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks </b>over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. Uses a selective search for region proposals.
