### Front
Explain the <b>architecture</b> of <b>Single Shot MultiBox
Detectors</b>?

### Back
Use detectors at varous stages with varying number of default
boxes. The SSD approach is based on a <b>feed-forward convolutional
network</b> that produces a <b>fixed-size collection of bounding
boxes and score</b>s for the presence of object class instances in
those boxes, followed by a <b>non-maximum suppression</b> step to
produce the final detections. The early network layers are based on
a standard architecture used for high-quality image classification
(truncated before any classification layers), which we will call
the base network e.g., VGG16. They then add auxiliary structure to
the network to produce detections. <b>Visualization:</b> <img src=
