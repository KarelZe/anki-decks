<b>Aleatoric uncertainty:</b> Noise inherent in the data
observations. Can be explained by unlimited sensoring. Irreducable,
but can be learned. <b>Homoscedastic:</b> same for all inputs e.
g., imprecise sensor <b>Heteroscedastic:</b> uncertainty can vary
with input. <b>Epistemic:</b> Model uncertainity. It's reducible
and measures what the model doesn't know. Can be explained with
infinite data.
