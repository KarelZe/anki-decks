### Front
What is the idea of depthwise separable convolution?

### Back
Split the convolution into depth- and point-wise convolutional parts. Similar to Spatially Seperable Convolution (split a matrix into two vectors), this reduces the number of operations, while ensuring practically the same result. <div><img src="Screenshot 2019-07-23 at 16.49.44.png">
