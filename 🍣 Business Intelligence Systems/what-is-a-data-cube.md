What is a <b>data cube</b>?

### Back
A <b>data cube</b> is used to represent data or facts along some
measure of interest. A <b>cell</b> contains one or more facts (a
function of the dimensions).
<div>
  The edges of the cube represent the dimensions. If there are 2
  dimensions, it's a table. If there are 3 dimensions, it's a cube.
  With more dimensions it's a multidimensional domain structure.
