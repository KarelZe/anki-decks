### Front
A company operates massive amounts of data both structured and unstructured.

For example, a transportation company that uses telematics devices in its fleet may need to process huge volumes of diverse data generated by sensors, video recorders, GPS trackers, etc. All that data processing requires great resources as well as investments in those resources.

Between an ETL and a ELT approach, which approach would be better for the company?

### Back
ELT is the way to save money and achieve better performance.
