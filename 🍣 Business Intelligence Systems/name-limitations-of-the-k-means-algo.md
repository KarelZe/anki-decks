### Front
Name limitations of the \(k\)-Means algorithm.

### Back
\(k\)-means works poorly if:
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Finding similarities between objects and allocate objects
    <li>Objects should be similar (or related) to one another
    within the same group
    <li>Dissimilar (or unrelated) objects in different groups
  </ul>
</div>
