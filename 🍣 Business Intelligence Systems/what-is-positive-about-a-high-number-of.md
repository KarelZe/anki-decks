### Front
What is positive about a high number of dimensions? What is negative about it?

### Back
<b>Pro:</b> Adding more dimensions leads to a higher probability to separate the data points.
<b>Con:</b> 
<ul><li>Too many dimensions can lead to overfitting, meaning the classifier does not perform well on unseen data.</li><li>If we keep adding dimensions, the amount of training data needs to grow exponentially fast to maintain the same coverage and to avoid overfitting.</li></ul>
