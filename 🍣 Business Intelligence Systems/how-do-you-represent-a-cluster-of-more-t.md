### Front
How do you represent a <b>cluster </b>of <b>more than one point</b>? Differentiate between Euclidean and Non-Euclidean space.

### Back
In the Euclidean space, we can represent each cluster by its
centroid = average of its points.
<div>
  In a non-Euclidean space (i. e. there is no average of two
  points), we can use the clusteroid = (data) point "closest" to
  other points.
</div>
<div>
  Centroid \(c_q\): "middle" of the cluster \(C_q\)
</div>
