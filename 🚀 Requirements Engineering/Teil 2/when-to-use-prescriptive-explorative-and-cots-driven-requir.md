## Front
When to use <b>prescriptive</b>, <b>explorative</b> and
<b>COTS-driven requirements engineering</b>?

## Back
<b>Prescriptive process</b>
<ul>
  <li>Requirements specification is a contract: All requirements
  are binding and must be implemented
  <li>Functionality determines cost and deadlines
  <li>Needed when tendering design and implementation
  <li>Development of specified system may be outsourced
  <li>Frequently combined with linear processes
</ul><b>Explorative process</b>
<ul>
  <li>Only goals known, concrete requirements have to be explored
  <li>Stakeholders strongly involved, continuous feedback
  <li>Prioritizing and negotiating requirements to be implemented
  <li>Deadlines and cost constrain functionality
  <li>Typically works only with evolutionary processes
</ul><b>COTS-driven process</b>
<ul>
  <li>System will be implemented with COTS software
  <li>Requirements must reflect functionality of chosen COTS
  solution
  <li>Requirements need to be prioritized according to importance
  <li>Frequently, only requirements not covered by the COTS
  solution are specified
</ul>
