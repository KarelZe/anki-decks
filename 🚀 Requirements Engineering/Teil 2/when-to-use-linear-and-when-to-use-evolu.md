### Front
When to use <b>linear</b> and when to use <b>evolutionary
processes</b> in <b>requirements engineering</b>?

### Back
<b>Linear</b>
<ul>
  <li>Clear, stable, a priori known requirements
  <li>Low risk (of developing the wrong system)
  <li>Relatively short duration of project
  <li>Complex requirements change process is acceptable
</ul><b>Evolutionary</b>
<ul>
  <li>Evolving requirements
  <li>High risk (of developing the wrong system)
  <li>Long duration of project
  <li>ability to change requirements easily is important
</ul>
