## Front
What are the <b>pros</b> and <b>cons</b> of proving <b>system
properties</b>?

## Back
<b>Pros:</b>
<ul>
  <li>model checking is fully automatic and produces
  counter-examples in case of failure
  <li>exploring feasible subsets is a systematic, automated test
</ul><b>Cons:</b>
<ul>
  <li>classic proofs are still hard and labour-intensive
  <li>exploring the full state space is frequently infeasible
</ul>
