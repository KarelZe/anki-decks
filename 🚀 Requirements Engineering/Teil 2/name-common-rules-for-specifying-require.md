### Front
Name <b>common rules</b> for <b>specifying requirements</b> in <b>natural language</b>. (Common exam task)

### Back
<ul>
  <li>Use active voice and defined subjects
  <li>Build phrases with complete verbal structure
  <li>Use terms as defined in the glossary
  <li>Define precise meanings for auxiliary verbs (shall, should,
  must, may,\(\ldots\) ) as well as for process verbs (for example,
  "produce", "generate", "create")
  <li>Check for nouns with unspecific semantics ("the data", "the
  customer", "the display",..) and replace where appropriate When
  using adjectives in comparative form, specify a reference point:
  "better" -> "better than"
  <li>Scrutinize all-quantifications: "every", "always", "never",
  etc. seldom hold without any exceptions
  <li>Scrutinize nominalizations ("authentication",
  "termination"...): they may conceal incomplete process
  specifications
  <li>State every requirement in a main clause. Use subordinate
  clauses only for making the requirement more precise
  <li>Attach a unique identifier to every requirement
  <li>Structure natural language requirements by ordering them in
  sections and sub-sections
  <li>Avoid redundancy where possible: "never ever" -> "never"
</ul>
