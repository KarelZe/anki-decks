## Front
What <b>dimensions / approaches</b> are typically combined in
<b>requirements engineering</b>? When are these combinations used
best?

## Back
<b>Participatory:</b> evolutionary & exploratory &
customer-specific. Used for: Supplier and customer closely
collaborate; customer stakeholders strongly involved both in
specification and development processes. <b>Contractual:</b>
typically linear (sometimes evolutionary) & prescriptive &
customer-specific. Used for: Specification constitutes contractual
basis for development of a system by people not involved in the
specification and with little stakeholder interaction after the
requirements phase. <b>Product-oriented:</b> evolutionary & mostly
explorative & market-oriented. Used when: An organization specifies
and develops software in order to sell/distribute it as a product.
<b>COTS-aware:</b> [evolutionary | linear] & COTSdriven &
customer-specific. Used when: The requirements specification is
part of a project where the solution is mainly implemented by
buying and configuring COTS
