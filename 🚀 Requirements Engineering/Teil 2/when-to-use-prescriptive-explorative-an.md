### Front
When to use <b>prescriptive</b>, <b>explorative </b>and <b>COTS-driven requirements engineering</b>?

### Back
<b>Prescriptive process</b>
<ul><li>Requirements specification is a contract: All requirements are binding and must be implemented</li><li>Functionality determines cost and deadlines</li><li>Needed when tendering design and implementation</li><li>Development of specified system may be outsourced</li><li>Frequently combined with linear processes</li></ul><b>Explorative process</b>
<ul><li>Only goals known, concrete requirements have to be explored</li><li>Stakeholders strongly involved, continuous feedback</li><li>Prioritizing and negotiating requirements to be implemented</li><li>Deadlines and cost constrain functionality</li><li>Typically works only with evolutionary processes</li></ul><b>COTS-driven process</b>
<ul><li>System will be implemented with COTS software</li><li>Requirements must reflect functionality of chosen COTS solution</li><li>Requirements need to be prioritized according to importance</li><li>Frequently, only requirements not covered by the COTS solution are specified</li></ul>
