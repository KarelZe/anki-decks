## Front
What can be modelled in class/object models? What can't?

## Back
<b>Can</b>
<ul>
  <li>Objects as classes or abstract objects
  <li>Local properties as attributes
  <li>Relationships / non-local properties as associations
  <li>Services offered by objects as operations on objects or
  classes (called features in UML)
</ul><b>Can't</b>
<ul>
  <li>Object behaviour must be modelled in separate state machines
  in UML
  <li>System-context interfaces and functionality from a user's
  perspective can't be modelled adequately
</ul>
