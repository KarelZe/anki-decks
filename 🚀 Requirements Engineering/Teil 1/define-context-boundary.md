## Front
Define <b>context boundary</b>.

## Back
Boundary between the context of a system and those parts of the
application and domain that are irrelevant for the system and its
requirements. <b>Intuition:</b> Context boundary limits what
information is considered. <b>Example:</b> Irrelevant where people
sleep. That is, not part of context.
