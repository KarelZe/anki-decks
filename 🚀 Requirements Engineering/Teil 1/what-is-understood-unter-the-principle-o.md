### Front
What is understood unter the principle of RE, that requirements and design is intertwined?

### Back
Specification and implementation are inevitably intertwined:
<ul>
  <li>Hierarchical intertwinement: high-level design decisions
  inform lower-level requirements
  <li>Technical feasability: non-feasible requirements are useless
  e.g., communication to Australia without latency
  <li>Validation: what you see is what you require e.g., people
  need to see the options to know what they need
</ul><b>Visualization:</b> <img src=
