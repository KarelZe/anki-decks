## Front
One can classify requirements by representation into
<b>operational, quantitative, qualitative, declarative
requirements</b>. How can each of these be validated?

## Back
<ul>
  <li><b>Operational:</b> Through review, test or formal
  verification
  <li><b>Quantiative:</b> Measurement (at least on an ordinary
  scale)
  <li><b>Qualitative</b>: No direct verification. Either by
  subjective stakeholder judgement of deployed system, or
  prototype, or indirectly by goal refinement or derived metrics
  <li><b>Declarative:</b> Review
</ul>
