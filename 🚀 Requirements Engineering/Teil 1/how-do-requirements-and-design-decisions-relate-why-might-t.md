## Front
How do requirements and design decisions relate? Why might the classical approach be missleading?

## Back
In traditional belief what is built is written down in the
specification. How it's done is the design. In practice, what and
how are context dependent and <b>do not</b> provide a useful
distinction. Requirements should be documented separately.
Distinguish operationally:
<ul>
  <li>If a statement is owned by stakeholder (i.e., changing it
  requires stakeholder approval), it's a requirement
  <li>If a statement is owned by the supplier (i. e., the supplier
  may change it freely, it's design)
</ul>
