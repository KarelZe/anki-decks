### Front
Explain the concept of <b>world and the machine</b> by <b>Zave </b>and <b>Jackson</b>.

### Back
<b>Definition:</b> Given a machine the specification \(S\) and
assuming the domain properties \(D\) hold, the requirements \(R\)
in the real world must also be satistfied \(S \wedge D \vdash R\).
\(D\) describes the properties of the domain in the real world.
Required behaviour is given by \(R\) in a real world domain. A
machine with capabilities is described in specification \(S\).
<b>Intuition:</b> Requirements must hold in the world. We need
requirements to build machines (aka systems).
