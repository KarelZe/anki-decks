Modelling a system in its context
<ul>
  <li>Determine the level of specification
  <li>Usually no system internals (-> system as black box)
  <li>Model actors which interact directly with the system
  <li>Model interaction between the system und its actors
  <li>Model interaction among actors
  <li>Represent result graphically
</ul><b>Example:</b> <img src= 
"paste-b20b48bbca6d855809f7a55b821fbfac79959269.jpg"> Four actors.
Other systems might also use the system.
