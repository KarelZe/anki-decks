### Front
How do requirements and design decisions relate? Why might the classical approach be missleading?

### Back
In traditional belief what is built is written down in the  specification. How it's done is the design. In practice, what and how are context dependent and <b>do not</b> provide a useful distinction.

Requirements should be documented separately.

Distinguish operationally:
<ul><li>If a statement is owned by stakeholder (i.e., changing it requires stakeholder approval), it's a requirement</li><li>If a statement is owned by the supplier (i. e., the supplier may change it freely, it's design)</li></ul>
