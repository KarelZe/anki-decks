### Front
How can the <b>problem of evolution</b> in <b>Requirements
Engineering</b> be solved?

### Back
<ul>
  <li><b>Very short development cycles</b> (1-6 weeks) (similar to
  SCRUM) or only add requirements after the development cycle
  <li><b>Explicit requirements management</b> (process when
  requirements have to be really changed with feedback from devs)
</ul>
