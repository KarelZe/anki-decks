      <li>A backpropagation network needs not to be strictly feed
      forward and can not have recurrent connections
      <li>Only accepts a fixed-size vector as input (e. g. image)
      and produce a fixed-size vector as output (e. g.
      probabilities of different classes)
      <li>Fixed amount of computational steps e. g. number of
      layers
    </ul>
