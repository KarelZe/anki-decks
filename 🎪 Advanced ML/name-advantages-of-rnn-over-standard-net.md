### Front
Name advantages of <b>RNN</b> over <b>Standard Networks</b>.

### Back
<div>
<div><ol>
<li>Input and output may have different lengths for different training examples</li>
<li>Standard
 networks do not share previously learned features across different 
positions in a given text. This leads to poor quality, as feature might 
be recognized in one context, but not in another. <i>Example:</i> Name in one sentence but not another.</li>
</ol>
