          In superivsed learning we observe both a set of features
          \(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{P}\) for each object, as well
          as a response or outcome variable \(Y\). The goal is then
          to predict \(Y\) using \(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{P}\).

      <li>
        <div>
          In unsupervised learning, we observe only the features
          \(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{P}\). We are not interested in
          prediction, because we do not have an associated response
          variable \(Y\).
