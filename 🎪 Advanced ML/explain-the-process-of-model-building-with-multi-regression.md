      <li>Select single explantory variable with high correlation
      to the dependent variable.
      <li>Perform a F-test to determine whether the independent
      variable is significant for regression.
      <li>If \(x_1\) is significant, we retain \(x_1\) and consider
      the next independent variables, that best explain the
      remaining variation in \(y\). This additional independent
      variable \(x_2\) must be the one with the highest coefficient
      of partial determination.
