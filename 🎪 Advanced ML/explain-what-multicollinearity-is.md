## Front
Explain what Multicollinearity is.

## Back
Multicollinearity refers to the situation in which more than two
explantory variables in a multiple regression model are <b>highly
correlated</b>.
<div>
  Tests for multicollinearity are necessary after the models
  significance has been determined and all significant independent
  variables, as if strong multicollinearity is present, a change in
  one explantory variable will also lead to a change of another
  explantory variable.
