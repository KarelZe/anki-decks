      logistic regression.
      <li>When not, logistic regression (with ridge penalty) and
      SVM very similar.
      <li>Logistic Regression can estimate probabilities.
      <li>Kernel SVMs are popular for nonlinear boundaries.
      <li>Kernels with Logistic Regression is computionally
      expensive
      <li>Logistic Regression is both interpretable and fast.
