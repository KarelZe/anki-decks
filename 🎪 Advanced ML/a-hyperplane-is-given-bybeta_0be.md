### Front
A hyperplane is given by:
<div>
  \[\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} X_{1}+\beta_{2} X_{2}+\ldots+\beta_{P}
  X_{P}=0\]
</div>
<div>
  Write down its normal vector.
</div>

### Back
The vector \(\beta=\left(\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}, \beta_{2}, \ldots, \beta_{P}\right)\) is called the normal vector, it points in a direction orthogonal to the surface of a hyperplane.
