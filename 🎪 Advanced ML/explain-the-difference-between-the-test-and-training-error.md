      <li>The <strong>test error</strong> is the average error that
      results from using a statistical learning method to predict
      the response on a new observation, on data that was not used
      in training the method.
      <li>the <strong>training error</strong> can easily be
      calculated by applying a statistical learning method to the
      observations used in training.
