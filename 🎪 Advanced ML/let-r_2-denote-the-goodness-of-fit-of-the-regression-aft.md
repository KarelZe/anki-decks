## Front
Let \(R_2\) denote the goodness-of-fit of the regression after the
additional explanatory variable has been added and \(R_1^2\) the
goodness of fit.
<div>
  Which distribution does \(R^2 - R_1^2\) follow?
</div>

## Back
\(R^2 - R_1^2\)  is a \(\chi^2\)-distributed with one degree of freedom.
