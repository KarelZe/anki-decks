    <ul>
      <li>rf uses a s mall random subset of explanatory variables
      for gowing in each paricular tree. Boosting however, selects
      from a complete list of explanatory variables.
      <li>Boosting a tree sequentially depends on the previous
      iteration. rf trees can be built independently in each
      iteration.
