### Front
Does omitting sensitive information lead to greater fairness?

### Back
No, as:
<ul>
  <li>sensitive information can be embedded in presumably
  legitimate features e. g. Amazon example; this is often referred
  to as redundant encoding e. g. race and prime members
  <li>Some sensitive information is important for outcome e. g.
  gender in sport
  <li>Sensitive and innocent features can be perfectly
  correlated.⚠️
</ul>
