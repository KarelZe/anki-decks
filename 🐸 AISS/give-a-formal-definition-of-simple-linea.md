### Front
Give a <b>formal definition</b> of <b>simple linear regression</b>.

### Back
With \(\boldsymbol{Y}\) as dependent an \(\boldsymbol{X}\) as independent variable (one feature) a simple linear regression can be formulated as:<div>
</div><div>\[\boldsymbol{Y}=\boldsymbol{\beta}_{0}+\boldsymbol{\beta}_{1} \boldsymbol{X}+\varepsilon\]</div><div>
</div><div>\(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{0}\) is the intercept and \(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{1}\) the slope. Both parameters are calculated by minimizing the sum of squared errors.
</div><div>
</div><div>\(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\) is the mean-zero random error term. It stands for all errors in the model (no linear relationship, measurement errors, more than one independent variable).</div>
