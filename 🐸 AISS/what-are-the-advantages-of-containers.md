  because container contains every dependency and configuration.
  <li><strong>Efficiency 💰:</strong> by not using an entire OS,
  emulated by a virtual machine
  <li><strong>Isolation 🧊:</strong> provides a consistent
  environment. Every application runs in its own sandbox

  resources to one container but also adding more containers to the
  same container engine
</ul>
