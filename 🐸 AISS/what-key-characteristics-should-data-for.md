learning</b> have?

### Back
<ul>
  <li><b>Massively distributed:</b> The data is distributed over a
  large number of nodes K . K can be bigger than the data n.
  <li><b>Non-IID:</b> Data on each node may be drawn from different
  distributions
  <li><b>Unbalanced:</b> N is distributed unevenly over K.
  <li><b>Sparse:</b> Features are occurring on small subset of N
  <li>(<b>Uncertain:</b> (big data characteristics) often created
  by users indirectly through their interaction with mobile devices
  (user interaction data)
  <li>(<b>Limited communication:</b> Offline or slow, set of users
  is unpredictable)
</ul>
