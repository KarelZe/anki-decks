What is a <b>Support Vector Machine</b>?

### Back
SVMs are based on the concept of hyperplane.<div>
</div><div>A hyperplane is in 2-D space a plane that separates the instances into two separate subsets. The closest instances to the hyperplane are called support vectors. </div><div>
</div><div>We aim to maximize the distance to the support vectors.

Standard SVMs without kernels assume data to be linear separatable.</div><div>
