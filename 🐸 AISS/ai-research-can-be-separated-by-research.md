</div><div><b>Cognitive Modeling current:</b> an AI must be a machine with a mind, performing human thinking, not only based on the same output as a human when given the same input but also on the same reasoning steps which led to the very conclusion.</div><div><b>Laws of thought</b> (i. e. thinking rationally): An AI is required to arrive at a rational decision despite what a human might answer.</div><div><b>The Turing Test current</b> (i. e. acting humanly): An AI must act intelligently when interacting with humans. To accomplish these tasks, an AI must perform human tasks at least as good as humans. These requirements can be tested by the turing test.</div><div><b>The Rational Agent current:</b> An AI acts as a rational or intelligent agent. This agent does not only act autonomously but also with the objective to achieve the rationally ideal outcome.</div>
