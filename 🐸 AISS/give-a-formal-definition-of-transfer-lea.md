  <b>Definition</b>:
</div>
<div>
  Given a source domain \(D_{S}\) and learning task \(T_{S}\), a
  target domain \(D_{T}\) and learning task \(T_{T}\), transfer
  learning aims to help improve the learning of the target
  predictive function \(f_{T}\) in \(D_{T}\) using the knowledge in
  \(D_{S}\) and \(T_{S}\), where \(D_{S} \neq D_{T}\), or \(T_{S}
  \neq T_{T}\) <b>Explanation</b>: Transfer Learning describes a
  concept in machine learning where knowledge from one domain is
  transferred to another.

<div>
  The insight behind transfer learning (TL) is that generalization
  may occur not only within tasks, but also across tasks.
