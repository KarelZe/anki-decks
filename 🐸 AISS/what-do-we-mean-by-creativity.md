### Front
What do we mean by <b>creativity</b>?

### Back
The creative work is a novel work that is accepted as tenable or useful or <b>satisfying by a group</b> in <b>some point in time.</b> By "novel" I mean the creative product did not exist previously in precisely the same form. [...] it is necessary to distinguish between internal and external frames of reference.
