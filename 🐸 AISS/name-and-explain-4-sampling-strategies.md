### Front
Name and explain 4 <b>sampling strategies</b>.

### Back
<ul><li><b>Simple random sampling</b>: every data point has the same probability to get selected in the subset.</li><li><b>Systematic sampling:</b> all data points are ordered according to a criteria (e. g. timestamp). A start point is selected randomly and every data point in a specific distance (e. g.  every 10th data point) is selected.</li><li><b>Stratified sampling</b>: every data point is assigned to one of several categories based on a specific criteria (e. g. month). In every category, simple random sampling takes place, and the joint collection of every simple random sampling is the final subset.</li><li><b>Cluster sampling</b>: every data point is assigned to one of several clusters based on a specific criteria (e. g. postal region). Some of the clusters are selected randomly and the joint of selected clusters consist the final subset.</li></ul>
