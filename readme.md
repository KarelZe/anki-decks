If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to make small edits to the markdown files directly. The anki decks (releases) will be then rebuilt automatically.
To add new cards, delete old ones, add new decks etc., use [`ki`](https://github.com/langfield/ki), which provides a convenient way to collaborate on decks. Please refer to the [docs](https://langfield.github.io/ki/) to get started.

## Requirements

Some cards require LaTeX to be rendered correctly. For using anki together with LaTeX see [this webpage](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/math?id=latex).

## Caution

:warning: **Please note, that the decks might contain errors or are incomplete. Some decks might also be outdated. Feel free to open an issue, if you find errors.**
