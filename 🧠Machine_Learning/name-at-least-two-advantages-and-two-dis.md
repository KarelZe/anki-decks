      <strong>Advantages:</strong>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Applicable to both regression and classification
      problems.
      <li>Handle categorical predictors naturally.
      <li>Computationally simple and quick to fit, even for large
      problems.
      <li>No formal distributional assumptions (non-parametric).
      <li>Can handle highly non-linear interactions and
      classification boundaries.
      <li>Very easy to interpret if the tree is small.
      Disadvantages:
    </ul>
    <div>
      <strong>Disadvantage</strong>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Accuracy: current methods, such as support vector
      machines and ensemble classifiers often have (30 %) lower
      error rates than CART.
      <li>Instability: If we change the data a little, the tree
      picture can change a lot. So the interpretation is not as
      straightforward as it appears.
