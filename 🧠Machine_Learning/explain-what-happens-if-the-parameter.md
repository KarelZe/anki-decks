Explain what happens if the parameter \(C\) is small, large or infinite for SVMs.

### Back
<div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Small \(C\). Constraints have little influence → large
      margin → large regularization
      <li>Large \(C\) Constraints have large influence → small
      margin → small regularization
      <li>\(C\) infinite: Constraints are enforced → hard margin →
      no regularization
    </ul>
