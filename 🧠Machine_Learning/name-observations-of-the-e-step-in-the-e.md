### Front
Name observations of the E-step in the EM algorithm. What happens to the marginal log-likelihood? What  happens to the KL distance?

### Back
The marignal log-likelihood \(\log p(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta})\) is unaffected by the E-step.<div>As KL is minimized the lower bound has to go up.</div><div>After the E-step \(\operatorname{KL}(q(z) \| p(z \mid \boldsymbol{x}))=0\) and therefore, the lowerbound is tight i. e.:</div><div>\(\log p(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta})=\mathcal{L}(q, \boldsymbol{\theta})\)
</div>
