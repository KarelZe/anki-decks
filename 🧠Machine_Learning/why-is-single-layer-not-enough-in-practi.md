### Front
Why is single layer not enough in practice, eventhough the Universal Approximation Theorem states it?

### Back
The problem is, that you'd need an exponential number of units,
otherwise you overfit.
<div>
  With multiple layers you can have similiar effects and have a
  compact representation with less units.
