### Front
One common model assumption in regression is that errors are normally distributed. How can normality be checked?

### Back
Using Q/Q plot. A Qâ€“Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other.

Can be used to check the normality assumption and quantiles (fraction below some value) of the standardized residuals (divided by MSE) vs. theoretical distribution.
