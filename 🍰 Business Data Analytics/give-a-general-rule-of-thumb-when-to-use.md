### Front
Give a general rule of thumb when to use Ridge regression and when to use LASSO?

### Back
<ul><li>LASSO will outperform Ridge in cases where a small number of predictors have a substantial effect on the response.</li><li>Ridge will perform better, as all predictor have roughly the same influence on the response.</li><li>However, no approach is superior in all cases.</li></ul>
