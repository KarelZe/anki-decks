### Front
Why are <b>correlations </b>in <b>observations </b>problematic in <b>reinforcement learning</b>?

### Back
<div><ul><li>Samples are not independent. Even if we accumulate a large batch of
data samples, they will all be very close to each other, as they will belong to
the same episode.</li><li>Distribution of our training data won't be identical to samples
provided by the optimal policy that we want to learn. Data that we have will be
a result of some other policy (our current policy, random, or both in the case
of epsilon-greedy), but we don't want to learn how to play randomly: we want an
optimal policy with the best reward.</li></ul></div>
