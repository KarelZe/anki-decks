<div><ul><li><u>Proof of Concept:</u> Scripts are written in Jupyter Notebooks or similar; ML code runs
on local computers or sandboxed VMs.</li><li><u>Proof of Value:</u> Code is written in reproducible package in collaboration among data
scientists; ML code runs on specialized hardware or cloud.</li><li><u>Continuous Improvement: </u>Automated ML pipelines (data preprocessing to model output) with
corresponding metadata store and model registry; infrastructure is scalable and
adaptable to any new use case.</li></ul></div>
