### Front
What is problematic about <b>multicollinearity</b> in
<b>regression</b>?

### Back
Multicollinearity happens when independent variables in the regression model are highly correlated to each other. 

It makes it hard to interpret of model and also creates an overfitting problem. Small change in the data lead to high changes in the estimate.
