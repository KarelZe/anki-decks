### Front
What is the <b>idea</b> behind <b>weighted regression</b>?

### Back
Weighted regression is a method that you can use when the least
squares assumption of constant variance in the residuals is
violated (heteroscedasticity). With the correct weight, this
procedure minimizes the sum of <b>weighted squared residuals</b> to
produce residuals with a constant variance (homoscedasticity). The
ideal <b>weight</b> is the <b>reciprocal of the variance</b> of the
<b>error</b>. <b>Visualization:</b> <img src=
