## Front
What are general <b>assumptions</b> in a <b>linear regression</b>
model?

## Back
<ul>
  <li>The model is linear in the parameters \(\beta\)
  <li>The sample of observations is random
  <li>There are no exact linear relationships among the independent
  <li>variables (no perfect collinearity)
  <li>The error \(\varepsilon\) has zero mean \(\quad
  E\left(\varepsilon \mid x_{1}, \ldots, x_{p}\right)=0\)
  <li>Homoscedasticity: The error \(\varepsilon\) has the same
  variance given any values
  <li>of expanatory varaibles \(\operatorname{Var}\left(\varepsilon
  \mid x_{1}, \ldots, x_{p}\right)=\sigma^{2}\)
  <li>The error \(\varepsilon\) is normally distributed
  <li>Errors are uncorrelated
  <li>Given several predictors - relationship is addditive (no
  interaction)
</ul>
