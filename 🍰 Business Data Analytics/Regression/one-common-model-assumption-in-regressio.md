### Front
One common model assumption in regression is that errors are normally distributed. How can normality be checked?

### Back
Using Q/Q plot. A Q/Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a probability
plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability
distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. Can
be used to check the normality assumption and quantiles (fraction
below some value) of the standardized residuals (divided by MSE)
vs. theoretical distribution. <img src=
