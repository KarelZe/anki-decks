## Front
What is the main difference between <b>Ridge regression</b> and
<b>LASSO regression</b>?

## Back
<ul>
  <li>Ridge regression penalizes the coefficients and shirnks them
  towards zero. All predictors are part of the model.
  <li>Lasso penalizes coefficients so that hte last important
  predictors are excluded from the model. Lasso performs variable
  selection. Leads to sparse model.
</ul>
