## Front
Give a general rule of thumb when to use Ridge regression and when to use LASSO?

## Back
<ul>
  <li>LASSO will outperform Ridge in cases where a small number of
  predictors have a substantial effect on the response.
  <li>Ridge will perform better, as all predictor have roughly the
  same influence on the response.
  <li>However, no approach is superior in all cases.
</ul>
