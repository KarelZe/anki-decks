### Front
Explain the <b>curse of dimensionality</b> in the context of
<b>clustering</b>. Why is isn't the nearest neighbour not
meaningful any longer?

### Back
Data becomes <b>increasingly sparse</b> in <b>high dimensional space.</b>
Definitions of density and distance become <b>less meaningful.
</b>
In high dimensional spaces, the relative difference between max and min distance between any pair of points is close to 0
\[\lim _{d \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\text { MaxDist-MinDist }}{\text { MinDist }}=0\]
