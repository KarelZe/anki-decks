## Front
What is the <b>idea</b> behind the <b>Dunn Index</b>?

## Back
Comparsion of the degree of separation of the clustering \(C\) to
the degree of <b>compactness</b>. Clusters shoud be maximally apart
and as compact as possible. Dunn-Index combines both
<b>separation</b> and <b>compactness</b>:
\(\operatorname{Dunn}(C)=\frac{\operatorname{Sep}(C)}{\operatorname{Comp}(C)}\)
