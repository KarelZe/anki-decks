### Front
Name <b>common problems</b> with <b>high dimesional data</b>.

### Back
<ul>
  <li>Learning occurs with high computational cost
  <li>High dimesional data can lead to overfitting
  <li>Data is often randomly distributed in high dimensions and are
  highly correlated
  <li>Distance measures are less meaningful in high dimensional
  spaces
</ul>
