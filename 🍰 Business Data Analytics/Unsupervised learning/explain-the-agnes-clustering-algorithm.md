## Front
Explain the <b>AGNES clustering algorithm</b>.

## Back
The AGNES algorithm constructs a hierarchy of clusterings. At
first, each observation is a small cluster by itself. Clusters are
merged until only one large cluster remains which contains all the
observations. At each stage the two nearest clusters are combined
to form one larger cluster. <b>Visualization:</b> <img src="paste-b784cf48ae00c8779f889d6b40c77f2edb6453c7.jpg"> <img src="paste-ea56ec7df5e95395ba4fb0a3a31c908548f19c10.jpg">
