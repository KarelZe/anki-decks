## Front
Explain the <b>curse of dimensionality</b> in the context of
<b>clustering</b>. Why is isn't the nearest neighbour not
meaningful any longer?

## Back
Data becomes <b>increasingly sparse</b> in <b>high dimensional
space.</b> Definitions of density and distance become <b>less
meaningful.</b> In high dimensional spaces, the relative difference
between max and min distance between any pair of points is close to
0 \[\lim _{d \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\text { MaxDist-MinDist
}}{\text { MinDist }}=0\]
