### Front
What is the <b>idea </b>of <b>noisy networks</b> in <b>Reinforcement Learning</b>?

### Back
Normally distributed noise added to fully connected layers can speed up the training process for long-episode games with potential stationarity.

The parameters of the noise are then optimized along with the network weights.
