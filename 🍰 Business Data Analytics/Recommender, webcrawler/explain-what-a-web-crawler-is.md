## Front
Explain what a <b>web crawler</b> is.

## Back
A web <b>crawler</b> or <b>spider</b> is a standalone bot that
systematically scans the Internet for indexing and searching for
content, following internal links on web pages. At its core, it is
an element of recursion: the crawler retrieves page contents for a
URL, examines that page for another URL, and retrieves that page,
ad infinitum.
