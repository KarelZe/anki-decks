### Front
What is the <b>idea </b>behind <b>weighted regression</b>?

### Back
Weighted regression is a method that you can use when the least squares assumption of constant variance in the residuals is violated (heteroscedasticity).

With the correct weight, this procedure minimizes the sum of <b>weighted squared residuals</b> to produce residuals with a constant variance (homoscedasticity). The ideal <b>weight </b>is the <b>reciprocal of the variance</b> of the <b>error</b>.
