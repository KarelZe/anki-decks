### Back
<b>Supervised:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Requires labled data
  <li>Sample training set (gold standard / ground truth) is used to
  teach the model about the specific problem domain
  <li>Evaluation against ground truth data
</ul><b>Unsupervised:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Model has to learn the problem domain by itself e. g., by
  evaluating endogenous metrics.
  <li>Requires separate evaluation
</ul>
