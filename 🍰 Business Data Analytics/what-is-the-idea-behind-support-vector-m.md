### Front
What is the <b>idea</b> behind <b>Support Vector Machines</b>?

### Back
<ul>
  <li>The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to
  find a hyperplane in an \(N\)-dimensional space that distinctly
  classifies the data points.
  <li>Support vectors are data point that are close to the
  hyperplane and help to maximize the margin.
