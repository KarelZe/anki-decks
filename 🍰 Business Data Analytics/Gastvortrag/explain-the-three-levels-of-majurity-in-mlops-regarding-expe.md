  <ul>
    <li><u>Proof of Concept:</u> Scripts are written in Jupyter
    Notebooks or similar; ML code runs on local computers or
    sandboxed VMs.
    <li><u>Proof of Value:</u> Code is written in reproducible
    package in collaboration among data scientists; ML code runs on
    specialized hardware or cloud.
    <li><u>Continuous Improvement:</u> Automated ML pipelines (data
    preprocessing to model output) with corresponding metadata
    store and model registry; infrastructure is scalable and
    adaptable to any new use case.
