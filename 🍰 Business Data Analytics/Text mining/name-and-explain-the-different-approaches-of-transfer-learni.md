## Front
Name and explain the different <b>approaches</b> of <b>transfer
learning</b>.

## Back
<ul>
  <li><b>Instance transfer:</b> To re-weight some labelled data in
  the source domain for the use in the target domain
  <li><b>Feature representation transfer:</b> Find a "good" feature
  representation that reduces difference between the source and the
  target domain and the error of classification and regression
  models.
  <li><b>Parameter transfer:</b> Discover shared parameters or
  priors between the source domain and the target models, which can
  benefit from transfer learning.
  <li><b>Relational knowledge transfer:</b> Build mapping of
  relational knowledge between the source domain and the target
  domain. Bot domains are relational domains and i. i. d.
  assumption is relaxed in each domain.
</ul>
