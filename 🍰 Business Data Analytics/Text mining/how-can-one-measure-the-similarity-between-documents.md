## Front
How can one <b>measure</b> the <b>similarity</b> between
<b>documents</b>?

## Back
Each term from the collection becomes a <b>dimension</b> in the
\(n\)-dimensional space. A document is a vector in this space,
where <b>term weights</b> serve as <b>coordinates.</b> <b>Cosine
similarity</b> \(\cos (\theta)=\frac{u \cdot
v}{\|u\|_{2}\|v\|_{2}}\) measures the similarity between the
documents.
