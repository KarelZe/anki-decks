### Front
What is problematic about the \(R^2\)?

### Back
The \(R^2\) increases if more variables are added, buti it does not mean better fit/prediction, as each predictor allows for a better fit to data.

Given more predictors residual standard error (RSE) can increase, if decrease in \(R S S\) is small relatively to increase in number of \(p\)
\[R S E=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-p-1} R S S}\]

Use \(R_{a d j}^{2}\) istead.
