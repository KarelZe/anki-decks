### Front
Name and explain the different <b>approaches</b> of<b> transfer learning</b>.

### Back
<ul><li><b>Instance transfer:</b> To re-weight some labelled data in the source domain for the use in the target domain</li><li><b>Feature representation transfer:</b> Find a "good" feature representation that reduces difference between the source and the target domain and the error of classification and regression models.</li><li><b>Parameter transfer:</b> Discover shared parameters or priors between the source domain and the target models, which can benefit from transfer learning.</li><li><b>Relational knowledge transfer:</b> Build mapping of relational knowledge between the source domain and the target domain. Bot domains are relational domains and i. i. d. assumption is relaxed in each domain.</li></ul>
