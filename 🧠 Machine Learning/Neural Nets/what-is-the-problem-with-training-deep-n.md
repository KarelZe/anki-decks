### Front
What is the <b>problem</b> with training <b>deep networks</b>?

### Back
One would expect, that models perform at least as well as shallower
models. Meaning they yield a better or equal training or test

<div>
  In practice deeper models often perform worse, as they are harder
  to optimize.
