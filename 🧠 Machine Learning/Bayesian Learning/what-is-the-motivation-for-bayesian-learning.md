## Front
What is the motivation for <b>Bayesian Learning</b>?

## Back
<ul>
  <li>Instead of using a point estimate for the parameter vector
  \(\theta^{*}\), we also consider uncertainty for the parameter
  vector.
  <li>Tries to find a more robust predictor by averaging over
  (infinitely) many predictors.
  <li>Uses estimate to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction.
</ul>
