## Front
Explain what a <b>Bayes classifier</b> is.

## Back
It assigns every instance to the most probable class \(Y\) based on
all given input features \(X\). By applying Bayes' theorem, a
function to describe the probability can be written as:
<div>
  \(P(Y \mid X)=\frac{P(Y) * P(X \mid Y)}{P(X)}\)
</div>
