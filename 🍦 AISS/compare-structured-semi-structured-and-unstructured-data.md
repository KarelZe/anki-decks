  <li><strong>Structured data</strong>: Data from relational
  database in row and column-form. It has relational keys and a
  fixed, predefined structure.
  <li><strong>Semi-Structured data</strong>: A form of structured
  data, but lacks of the formal structure of a relational database.
  Often follows a self-describing structure with some
  organizational properties which create a order in the data.
  <li><strong>Unstructured data</strong>: Data that follows no
  structure and is therefore hard to analyze.
