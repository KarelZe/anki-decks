## Front
Name and explain 3 <b>challenges</b> in analyzing <b>distributed
data sources</b>.

## Back
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data privacy</strong>: Different legal entities might
  not be allowed or willing to exchange data across entity borders
  <li><strong>Data heterogeneity</strong>: Data orignating from
  different entities might be of different shape, thus a
  comprehensive analysis might be problematic.
  <li><strong>Data velocity / volume</strong>: A data stream is
  produced faster than it can be transmitted or the transmission of
  a large data source is not feasible due to technical limitations.
</ul>
