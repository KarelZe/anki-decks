### Front
Name <b>challenges</b> in the deployed machine learning services in
<b>concept drift environments</b>.

### Back
<ul>
  <li>Detect concept drift as soon as possible📨
  <li>Adapt the model quickly if needed 🌀
  <li>Distinguish drifts from noise; robustness from noise 🫧
  <li>Recognize and treat recurring contexts (e. g. seasons) 🍂
  <li>Operate in less than example arrival time and with limited
  storage available ⏲️
</ul>
