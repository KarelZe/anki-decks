Explain what an <b>Artificial Neural Network</b> is?

<div>
  ANNs, are frameworks to mimic the funcionality of brains. ANNs
  consist of artificial neurons which are connected to each other.
  Neurons receive multiple input signals, multiply inputs with
  weights and produce a single signal based with a (often
  non-linear) activation function. The resulting signal is sent to
  multiple connected neurons.
</div>
<div>
  During the training phase, every neuron fits its weights
  individually to achieve a good prediction. By this process
  patterns and composition of the data is learned by the neural
  network.

<div>
  An ANN consists of a input layer, hidden layer and output layer.
