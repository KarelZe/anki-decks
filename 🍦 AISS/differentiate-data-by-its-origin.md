<ul>
  <li><strong>Batch data 🧱</strong>: Is static data. Batch data has
  been collected over a period of time and is then used as a whole.
  It is used when dealing with large amounts of data and the order
  and time of records are not important.
  <li><strong>Streaming data 🌊</strong>: Real time data. As soon as
  the data is collected, the data is used. Streaming data enables
  real-time analytics and is used for short response time. A data
  stream is often infinite.
</ul>
