### Front
Name and explain 4 <b>sampling strategies</b>.

### Back
<ul>
  <li><b>Simple random sampling</b>: every data point has the same
  probability to get selected in the subset.
  <li><b>Systematic sampling:</b> all data points are ordered
  according to a criteria (e. g. timestamp). A start point is
  selected randomly and every data point in a specific distance (e.
  g. every 10th data point) is selected.
  <li><b>Stratified sampling</b>: every data point is assigned to
  one of several categories based on a specific criteria (e. g.
  month). In every category, simple random sampling takes place,
  and the joint collection of every simple random sampling is the
  final subset.
  <li><b>Cluster sampling</b>: every data point is assigned to one
  of several clusters based on a specific criteria (e. g. postal
  region). Some of the clusters are selected randomly and the joint
  of selected clusters consist the final subset.
</ul>
