## Front
Compare <b>interpretability </b>and <b>explainability</b>.

## Back
<b>Interpretability</b>: Interpretability is about the extent to which a cause and effect can be observed within a system. Or the extent to which you are able to predict what is going to happen, given a change in input or algorithmic parameters.
<b>Explainability</b>: Extent to which inner mechanics of a machine can be explained in <b>human terms</b>. Interpretability is being able to discern the mechanics without necessarily knowing why.
