  <b>Cognitive Modeling current:</b> an AI must be a machine with a
  mind, performing human thinking, not only based on the same
  output as a human when given the same input but also on the same
  reasoning steps which led to the very conclusion.

<div>
  <b>Laws of thought</b> (i. e. thinking rationally): An AI is
  required to arrive at a rational decision despite what a human
  might answer.
</div>
<div>
  <b>The Turing Test current</b> (i. e. acting humanly): An AI must
  act intelligently when interacting with humans. To accomplish
  these tasks, an AI must perform human tasks at least as good as
  humans. These requirements can be tested by the turing test.
</div>
<div>
  <b>The Rational Agent current:</b> An AI acts as a rational or
  intelligent agent. This agent does not only act autonomously but
  also with the objective to achieve the rationally ideal outcome.
