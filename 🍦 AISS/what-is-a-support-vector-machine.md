What is a <b>Support Vector Machine</b>?

## Back
SVMs are based on the concept of hyperplane.
<div>
  A hyperplane is in 2-D space a plane that separates the instances
  into two separate subsets. The closest instances to the
  hyperplane are called support vectors.
</div>
<div>
  We aim to maximize the distance to the support vectors. Standard
  SVMs without kernels assume data to be linear separatable.
