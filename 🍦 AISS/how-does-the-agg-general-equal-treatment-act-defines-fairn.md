## Front
How does the AGG (General Equal Treatment Act) defines fairness? Can it be readily aplied to ML?

## Back
The objective of the General Equal Treatment Act is to prevent or stop discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, sex, religion or belief, disability, age, or sexual orientation.

It is however not designed for AI/ML-based decision making.
