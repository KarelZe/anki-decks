## Front
Does omitting sensitive information lead to greater fairness?

## Back
No, as:
<ul><li>sensitive information can be embedded in presumably legitimate features e. g. Amazon example; this is often referred to as redundant encoding e. g. race and prime members</li><li>Some sensitive information is important for outcome e. g. gender in sport</li><li>Sensitive and innocent features can be perfectly correlated.⚠️</li></ul>
