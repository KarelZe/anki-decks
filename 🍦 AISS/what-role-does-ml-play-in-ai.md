    One differentiates if the intelligent agents learn and how the
    agent is able to learn (e. g. what algorithms they use and what
    data processing is used, how concept drift is handled).
  </div>
  <div>
    One differentiates between <b>simple-reflex agents</b> and
    <b>learning agents</b>. This corresponds to the think layer,
    once trained and never touched again (simple-reflex) or
    continously updated and adaptive (learning).
  </div>
  <div>
    In the case of <b>simple-reflex agents</b>, ML takes place as a
    once-trained model in the <b>execution sublayer</b>.
  </div>
  <div>
    It can also be part of the <b>learning sublayer</b> of a
    learning agent to continously improve the model in the
    <b>execution sublayer</b>.
