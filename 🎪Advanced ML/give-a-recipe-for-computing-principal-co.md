Give a <b>recipe</b> for computing <b>principal components</b>.

Suppose we have a \(n * p\) data set \(X\). Since we are only
interested in variance, we assume that each of the variables in
\(X\) has been centered to have mean zero (that is, the column
means of \(X\) are zero).
<div>
  We then look for the linear combination of the sample feature
  values of the form \[P C A_{i 1}=\phi_{11} X_{i 1}+\phi_{21} X_{i
  2}+\ldots+\phi_{P 1} X_{i P}\]
</div>
<div>
  for \(i=1, \ldots, n\) that has largest sample variance, subject
  to the constraint that \(\sum_{j=1}^{p} \phi_{j 1}^{2}=1\).
</div>
<div>
  Since each of the \(x_{i j}\) has mean zero, then so does
  \(\text{PCA}_{i 1}\) (for any values of \(\phi_{j 1}\) ). Hence
  the sample variance of the \(P C A_{i 1}\) can be written as
  \(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{p} \text{PCA}_{i 1}^{2}\).
</div>
<div>
  Plugging into the last equation the first principal component
  loading vector solves the optimization problem maximize
</div>
<div>
  \[\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{P} \phi_{j 1} x_{i
  j}\right)^{2}\text{ subject to }\sum_{j=1}^{p} \phi_{j 1}^{2}=1\]
</div>
<div>
  This problem can be solved via a singular-value decomposition of
  the matrix \(X\), a standard technique in linear algebra.
</div>
<div>
  We refer to \(\text{PCA}_{1}\) as the first principal component,
  with realized values \(\text{PCA}_{11}, \ldots \text{PCA}_{n 1}\)
</div>
<div>
  The second principal component is the linear combination of
  \(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{P}\) that has maximal variance among
  all linear combinations that are uncorrelated with
  \(\text{PCA}_{1}\). The second principal component scores
  \(z_{12}, z_{22}, \ldots, z_{n 2}\) take the form \[\text{PCA}_{i
  2}=\phi_{12} X_{i 1}+\phi_{22} X_{i 2}+\ldots+\phi_{P 2} X_{i
  P}\] where \(\phi_{2}\) is the second principal component loading
  vector, with elements \(\phi_{12}, \ldots \phi_{p 2}\) It turns
  out that constraining \(\text{PCA}_{2}\) to be uncorrelated with
  \(\text{PCA}_{1}\) is equivalent to constraining the direction
  \(\phi_{2}\) to be orthogonal to the direction \(\phi_{1}\).
