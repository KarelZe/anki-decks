### Front
Can a buy, hold or sell decision be modelled by a <b>Linear
Regression Model</b>?

### Back
Consider a quantitative response variable, Y, as follows:
<div>
  \[Y=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 1 & \text { if hold } \\ 2 & \text {
  if buy } \\ 3 & \text { if sell } \end{array}\right.\]
</div>
<div>
  There is no natural way to convert a qualitative response
  variable with more than two levels into a quantitative response
  that is ready for linear regression.
