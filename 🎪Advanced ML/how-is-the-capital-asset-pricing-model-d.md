### Front
How is the Capital Asset Pricing Model defined?

### Back
The beta for an asset can be estimated using the following simple
linear regression: \[r_{i t}-r_{f t}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{i}\left[r_{M
t}-r_{f t}\right]+\epsilon_{i t}\] \(r_{i t}\) is observed return
on asset \(i\) for time \(t\)
<div>
  \(r_{f t}\) is observed return on the risk-free asset for time
  \(t\)
</div>
<div>
  \(r_{M t}\) is observed return on the market portfolio for time
  \(t\)
</div>
<div>
  \(\epsilon_{i t}\) is the error term for asset \(i\) for time
  \(t\)
</div>
