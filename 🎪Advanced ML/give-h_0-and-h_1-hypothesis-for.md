### Front
Give \(H_0\) and \(H_1\) Hypothesis for regression models.

### Back
\(H_0\) states that all regression coefficients are equal to zero,
which means none of the explanatory variables play any role.
<div>
  \(H_{0}: \beta_{0}=\beta_{1}=\cdots=\beta_{k}=0\)
</div>
<div>
  \(H_1\) states that at least one coefficient is different from
  zero.
</div>
<div>
  \(H_{1}: \beta_{j}=0 \text { for at least one } j\)
</div>
