### Front
Give the formula for <b>coefficient of partial determination</b>.

### Back
Formally, we have

\[\frac{S S E_{1}-S S E_{2}}{S S E_{1}},\]

\(\text{SSE}_{1}=\) the variation left unexplained by \(x_{1}\). \(\text{SSE}_{2}=\) the variation left unexplained after both \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) have been included.
