### Front
How does an increase in \(X\) affect \(p(X)\) in a <b>Logistic
Regression Model</b>?

### Back
The amount that \(p(X)\) changes due to a one-unit change in \(X\)
will depend on the current value of \(X\).
<div>
  But regardless of the value of \(X\), if \(\beta_{1}\) is
  positive then increasing \(\mathrm{X}\) will be associated with
  increasing \(p(X)\), and if \(\beta_{1}\) is negative then
  increasing \(X\) will be associated with decreasing \(p(X)\).
</div>
