    <ul>
      <li><strong>One-to-one</strong>: This is the classic feed
      forward neural network architecture, with one input and we
      expect one output.
      <li><strong>Many-to-many</strong>: This model is ideal for
      machine translation like the one we see on Google translate.
      The inputcould an English sentence which has variable length
      and the output will be the same sentence in a different
      language which also has variable length.
