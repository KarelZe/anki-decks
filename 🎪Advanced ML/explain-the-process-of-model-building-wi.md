<li>Select single explantory variable with high correlation to the dependent variable.</li>
<li>Perform a F-test to determine whether the independent variable is significant for regression.</li>
<li>If \(x_1\) is significant, we retain \(x_1\) and consider the next independent 
variables, that best explain the remaining variation in \(y\). This 
additional independent variable \(x_2\) must be the one with the highest 
coefficient of partial determination.</li>
