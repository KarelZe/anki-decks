### Front
What is the central idea of <b>K-Fold Cross-Validation</b>?

### Back
Idea is to randomly divide the data into \(K\) equal-sized parts. We leave out part \(k\), fit the model to the other \(K-1\) parts (combined), and then obtain predictions for the left-out \(k\)-th part.

This is done in turn for each part \(k=1,2, \ldots, K\), and then the results are combined.<div>
