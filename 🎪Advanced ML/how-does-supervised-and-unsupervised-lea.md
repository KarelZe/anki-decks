How does <b>supervised</b> and <b>unsupervised</b> learning differ in terms of knowledge about the <b>response variable</b>.

<div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<div>In 
superivsed learning we observe both a set of features \(X_{1}, X_{2}, 
\ldots, X_{P}\) for each object, as well as a response or outcome 
variable \(Y\). The goal is then to predict \(Y\) using \(X_{1}, X_{2}, 
\ldots, X_{P}\).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>In 
unsupervised learning, we observe only the features \(X_{1}, X_{2}, 
\ldots, X_{P}\). We are not interested in prediction, because we do not 
have an associated response variable \(Y\).</div>
